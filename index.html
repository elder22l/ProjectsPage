                The first link is a playable computer science education game I made with a group of students (full credits in the GitHub ReadMe on my page). We were able to present it to first graders during a CS education week. Below that is a link to the original unity project with code on my co-developer's page.

                A clone of the NYT game Spelling Bee that was done in collaboration with another student. I programmed the Model and View packages and she programmed the Controller package. Full credits are in the ReadMe and commented on top of the classes.

                A cryptography cipher which takes a key and message and encrypts or decrypts a message using the scytale or caesar ciphers. This project was a solo effort.
